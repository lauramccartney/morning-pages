It is a surprise to find fresh figs, having grown up on dried puckered leathery ones and the fig newton.  They appear in late summer, blue black sheeny round perfection.  The most commonly grown in South Africa is called here Evita, but known in France as the gorgeous Violette de Sollies.  I couldn’t believe my eyes at first when I saw them on the cold shelves, was this an imaginary fruit?  And bought them on a whim.  They were a revelation.  Actually, Buddha was sitting under the Bodhi tree, a sacred fig, when he attained enlightenment.  Could it have been partially because of a fig?

My very favorite friends and I insist that we eat figs.As a poem in the mouth in the morning sun caramelized with butter, drizzled with honey and fresh thyme, and a morsel of gorgonzola; as the easiest sexiest salad in high summer fresh with basil, bocconcini and translucent parma ham; and when the nights begin to grow cold, a bit of fig wrapped in tasty bacon as tapas.

We luxuriate in the fig, actually an edible flower, which is believed to have been one of the first crops domesticated a thousand years before wheat.

At the end of fig season last year, our circle of women friends welcomed two writers travelling Africa.  I bought out all of the squishy glorious figs at the shop, breathing in their perfume.  At the last moment, jettisoning recipes, I decided we would eat the fresh purple figs out of hand.  We shared poetry and song late into the night - it was our last dinner before the world changed.  Now it is fig season again, we step tentatively into colder days, and I urge you to find some fresh figs.



Easiest sexiest salad – Jamie Oliver

This has the freshness of fig, the swirl of honey and lemon, green bite of basil; the salty magnificence of parma ham and creamy bocconcini.The sheer joy of living, of taste… luxe, calme and volupté – truly an invitation to this present moment.   

4 figs

4 slices Parma ham or prosciutto

4 slices buffalo mozzarella (I like using bocconcini)

A handful green or purple basil, leaves picked

6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil

3 tablespoons lemon juice

1 tablespoon good honey

Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper

1. For the salad: One thing I do is to criss-cross the figs but not quite to the bottom – 1 fig per person is always a good start. Then, using your thumbs and forefingers, squeeze the base of the fig to expose the inside. At this point you’ll think, ‘Oooh, that looks nice, I think I’m quite clever...’ or at least I do. More importantly, it allows your dressing to get right into the middle of the fig. All these little things really help to make a salad special. Simply place the figs in a dish, weave around 1 slice of Parma ham or prosciutto per fig, throw in some slices of buffalo mozzarella, rip over some green or purple basil and drizzle everything with the honey and lemon juice dressing. As far as salads go, it’s pretty damn sexy.
2. For the honey and lemon juice dressing: Mix everything together in a bowl and season to taste.
