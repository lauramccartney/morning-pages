It is a surprise to find fresh figs, having grown up on dried puckered leathery ones and the fig newton.  They appear in late summer, blue black sheeny round perfection.  The most commonly grown in South Africa is called here Evita, but known in France as Violette de Sollies.  I couldn’t believe my eyes at first, was this an imaginary fruit?  And bought them on a whim.  They were a revelation.  Actually, Buddha was sitting under the Bodhi tree, a sacred fig, when he attained enlightenment.  Could it have been partially because of a fig?



My very favorite friends and I insist that we eat figs.  As a poem in the mouth in the morning sun caramelized with butter, drizzled with honey and fresh thyme, and a morsel of gorgonzola; as the easiest sexiest salad in high summer fresh with basil, bocconcini and translucent parma ham; and when the nights begin to grow cold, a morsel of fig wrapped in (tasty) bacon as tapas.



We luxuriate in the fig, actually an edible flower, which is believed to have been one of the first (crops) domesticated a thousand years before wheat.

(How to know if ripe… most are fresh and floral but one is jammy and just right.)



At the end of fig season last year, our circle of women friends welcomed two writers visiting Africa.  I bought out all of the squishy glorious figs at the shop, breathing in their perfume.  At the last moment, jettisoning recipes, I decided we would eat the fresh purple figs out of hand.  We shared poetry and song late into the night - it was our last dinner before the world changed.  Now it is fig season again, we step tentatively into colder days, and I urge you to find some fresh figs.

This has the freshness of fig, the swirl of honey and lemon, green bite of basil; the salty magnificence of parma ham and creamy bocconcini.The sheer joy of living, of taste… luxe, calme and volupté – truly an invitation to this present moment.
