prompt: When my river reaches the ocean

My river has moved like a torrent

From place to place

Through mountains and plains

Picking up here and there

Many stories old and new

And other passengers too

\
It will soon arrive

At the Boundless Blue

Free at last to dissolve and disappear

Into the mother of all rivers

Where all things end

And begin again
