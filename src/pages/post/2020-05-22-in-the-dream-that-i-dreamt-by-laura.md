I saw you but you didn’t see me. I called out and suddenly there was a crowd between us. I began to fight my way through. At first pushing and shoving then carried back on the tide. I saw your hair moving in the distance. You weren’t caught up in the throngs. You glided effortlessly.

I was screaming your name. Throwing myself in to people. Overwhelmed with the need to show you myself. To confront you with the disaster you had created. To beat my fists on your chest and shout “How dare you”.

You were gone. I was stuck under a human ant hill. Bodies crawling over and around me. Automatons enacting their day, oblivious to the pulsing, riotous collapse happening inside of me. Here was deafening panic. There tranquility, oxygen.

Through the forest of legs I saw you again in a shop window. You were smiling. I screamed myself awake. I was in bed, panting like I’d ran a race. I felt my body subside in to the sheets. My blood cooled as I looked out of the window in to the sky. I was alone again.
