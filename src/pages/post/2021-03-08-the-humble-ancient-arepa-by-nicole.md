The arepas fry in the pan, jostling for space, as a warm fried aroma fills the kitchen. I flip them lovingly one by one. The ripe avocados sit on the wooden counter like petulant actors in the wings, waiting for their moment in the spotlight. Meanwhile, a sofrito of tomato and onion hisses and spits from the pot - my cue to pour in the black beans. Now, this is a contentious recipe, and no doubt if my mother was watching she’d be back-seat cooking.

‘You don’t cook the sofrito separately? No, no just wondering! That’s fine.’

I never thought I was good at or liked cooking until I became head chef and scullery maid for our family. Now I take pleasure in growing my baby’s lovely podgy body: her sunset pink cheeks, her rolling white thighs, each delicate creased finger.

This will be her first arepa. I don’t remember my own - but I do have an early memory of being in an arepería with my Abuelito and being proud as I was handed my own giant stuffed arepa. I was only as tall as his round, firm belly on top of which he always wore a pressed, short sleeved shirt, the buttons straining and trying their best to contain 70 years worth of arepas. My corncake tasted like mild white cheese, like this surreal other home I had, like oppressive heat and my grandmother’s tears falling on my head at the airport whenever we left.

The black beans simmer until they’re creamy while the arepas bake in the oven, socially distancing on the wire rack. I take a look and get a faceful of dry heat. They need a little longer.

Arepas are resilient things; a pre-Columbian dish that survived Spanish colonisation, unlike many other pre-contact traditions, and has remained virtually unchanged for 3,000 years. They are the link between an indigenous girl from the Timoto-Cuica tribe of the Andes and a woman in modern-day Caracas, for each of whom the arepa was and is a staple.

Another memory beckons as I inhale the wafting scents. It is this: my school skirt flapping against my thigh as I run down Shepherds Bush Market until I find the international foods shop. I’ve been tasked with buying three packets of harina pan and pay for them with pound coins from my damp fist. I run back to my mum’s car, nervous she’ll have left without me (on what universe?), gleefully clutching the garish yellow packets. That night, my mother will pat the arepa dough into neat circular moons and serve them to her Venezuelan friends while they raucously sing and tell filthy Spanish jokes that fly over my head. Arepas signified coming together, but more than that, they were a conduit for a kind of strange immigrant teleportation, a way for them to be back in their homeland whilst sitting in a London kitchen.

I mash the avocado, add glistening olive oil and a smattering of chilli flakes. My sister loves, no, idolises this meal with an almost unnatural fervour. I’d post her a serving if I could. I extract one arepa from the oven’s warm embrace, and do exactly what my mum taught me, for once. I hold it to my ear, piping hot, and tap on its belly like you’d gently knock on a Borrower’s tiny door. If it sounds hollow with a slight puff on either side, it’s ready.

We slice, open and slather the arepas’s insides with butter and fill them to our own tastes. The baby doesn’t know what she likes in hers yet. Will it be golden scrambled egg, slices of cheese or a reina pepiada, her great grandfather’s favourite? She’ll make it known, whatever her preference.

The baby approaches the unknown artefact tentatively. Is it food or foe? She nibbles and then gobbles and then holds her hand outstretched, asking for more.
