Rhubarb Upside Down Cake



“It’s a game of two halves”. Is a football expression I’ve never fully understood. Whether meant to be about space, time or performance, in making rhubarb upside down cake, I felt I was continuously enacting a game of two parts. This is not, two faced or split in personality but a construction which from beginning to eating is always about two perfectly complimentary aspects of a whole. Each supportive of the other and enabling being seen, tasted and experienced as its best self. This sweet is unpretentious yet complex in what it does and make me do.



In the measuring out, there’s separation between topping and cake. First is the preparation of the fruit. Spears of pinks, so vibrant the colour looks artificial, like children’s chewy sweets. I wash the dirt and the sometimes slimy skins. Cleaning, slicing, caramelising. Investing the time and care it begs for to be shown off and tasted at its best. It yields. After gentle turning a joy is ensuring their nestling in and arrangement is even and pleasing to the eye.



A separate endeavor, the next half is the mixing of the spicy cake dough. Vanilla, cinnamon, ginger,cloves and nutmeg. Mellow, yet unremarkable in itself, heimlich even. The buttermilk or kefir might give a curdly texture but separation is something this cake thrives off, it will even out. Dolloped down and around the pink ribbons, the cloudy shapes slowly conceal the treasure beneath.



Again two stages, from hob to oven it cooks and fills my kitchen with its homey fug. Once cool I nudge and ease her out lightly.Then with vigour I flip her over. She then shows off her rounded shape and patterned colour I trusted would still be there. The contrast of moist cakey brown supporting glossy garnet.



What was under has become over. I wonder if it is as much inside out as upside down.



Rhubarb is a candy cane kind of vegetable. Its colour looking like it should already burst with sugar. Uncooked she is quite tart with a very particular feminine floral scent. This queeenly colour belying the toxic properties within its leaves. Forced rhubarb is when the pink stems are lured out of their natural Winter hibernation early by forcing them with warmth and darkness. It is said you can hear it growing. Such a sensitive living thing. It has to be harvested by hand in candlelight. So romantic and a task so delicate. A cake which shows off this fruit must be one which made of love.



If a dream or memory were to be a cake, I would suggest that Upside Down Cake is a perfect fit. The core of the thing, be it fruit or vegetable is buried, like a fossil supported in batter waiting to be revealed. Patiently waiting to be coaxed out and up to the surface where it is experienced fully. Once this essence comes to the mind’s eye or eager lips our rhubarb skirts around exhibitionistically on warm cakey pillows. The foil which ultimately elevates the essential message of the fruit. The taste of her lingering for a while. To be enjoyed as it is or in partnership with creme fraiche or custard.



There are also two halves of my life. One being myself as a hungry child, the other being the boys I try to nurture. Although that girl still has an appetite and my current desires are still very alive to hers.

A sad, fat child who yearned to be thought about asked her grandmother to bake her a birthday cake. The lady dutifully made apple upside down cake. It wasn’t a favourite nor do I remember her having made it before. Upside Down cake is not a cake one usually associates with birthdays, but by the time this is written it will be mine. In making it my own here I needn’t use apples but it had to be upside down. If i have to make it myself and share it with my own special ones that will bring Grandma back for the making and the eating. As well as fill the bellies I love with that deep, sweet contentment. Upside down cake is a dependable kind of special I wanted to share.
