Go peanuts for chicken!



James Garfield was the 20th President of the United States and he believed that “Man cannot live by bread alone; he must have peanut butter.” To realize how much sense he makes, we must acquaint ourselves with the beautiful people of the Sahara Desert. My introduction to peanut butter surfaced right there with them, but it wasn't peanut butter as you know it!



When people don’t have much, food becomes paramount. Firstly, in its acquisition, then in its preparation, how to make something delicious out of one's sparse ingredients - a meal, a dish, a food, a taste that one can enjoy over and over again, as very often it will be the same staple that will be used at most meals.



This is the case in Mali, West Africa, where I spent my early years. I have clear memories of visiting villages like Timbuktu, Muslim women sitting together around the fire, surrounded by mud-huts and cloaked in billowing black silks. They would be sewing brightly colored leather cushions for sale, while simultaneously tending to communal sustenance, the evening meal bubbling on the heat.



Only 3% of land in the area is arable, so except for meat from their own herds, and staples like rice or millet, fresh food is scant. But the peanut. This is where the modest peanut shines and becomes the star of most dishes locally, sweet and savory. The Malian national dish is called TiguaDege Na, which means “peanut sauce with meat”. Notice which ingredient comes first in the name. The women of the Bambara tribe taught my mother how to make peanut butter chicken, any meat available can be used though.



Peanut butter in a jar was not available then, peanuts were roasted then grounded - this thickened the sauce and gave it a chunky fragrance. I recall sitting in our kitchen overlooking mango and grapefruit trees, the kitchen fogged with the rich scent of peanuts as the oils emanated from the nuts being crushed. In our home, it was served on mounds of the most perfect, bright white rice, each grain separate - a real talent of my mums, one that I have not yet been able to emulate successfully!



The creamy stew came out of a steaming pot, the chicken falling off the bone (thighs were predominantly used), drenched in a sand-brown glossy peanut sauce, evoking colors of the desert and bubbling like African drums in my mouth. I remember the bijoux beauty of the red and green peppers peeping out and goading me to tuck in. The chopped peanuts that adorned the dish, gave a welcome change of texture and the smell was everywhere for the whole day.



Today I often make this satisfying and comforting dish for my own family in New York, far away from the winds of Africa - it is a staple on “my fast and easy recipes” list. Every time I do, waves of nostalgia blow through me, inspiring greedy anticipation and childish pleasure. I have tweaked it slightly, I add chopped tomatoes and chicken broth to the mix of onions, garlic and peppers; cumin is essential and fennel seeds are optional. I must shamefully admit that I do now use bought peanut butter. I prefer the crunchy version because...texture. I chop roasted peanuts for the topping and parsley of course gives a touch of character. Greens accompany this dish traditionally, I prefer spinach or courgettes, but any vegetables will do.



Outside of its soothing qualities, it incites a feeling of hope, as we once again are reminded how nature and habitat stamps its mark on a culture, and food is at the epi-centre of any culture. Interestingly, just like the tribes in Africa, I have never written this recipe down, nor has my mother. Just like them, oral recipes stay in modern families for generations. This allows each person to develop their own version, while still remaining true to the original concept and main ingredients.



So next time you're looking for a heartening meal to make on the fly, think not what peanut butter can do for you but what you can do for peanut butter! Don't overlook the unpresuming jar in your pantry, rather make it the leading lady in one of the heartiest meals you'll ever create. It can do so much more than adorn toast, it is so much more than a simple snack - it can make family memories last. From generation to generation.
