**A very French Salad**

Have you ever bought a celeriac only to have it sitting in your fridge for days or even a few weeks, not knowing what to do with it?\
Or do you walk past an array of this gnarled vegetable on a market stall or on a supermarket shelf and reach for something more familiar?

The truth is this pre-historic looking vegetable does not entice us by its looks, nor invite enthusiasm as does a bunch of carrots or beetroots, or even potatoes. And yet, although not known to have a fondness for root vegetables in their cuisine, the French have made a national dish of the humble celeriac. Celeri Rave Remoulade has become a classic and simple hors d’oeuvre that adorns the menus of most bistros in France.

I was curious about the name remoulade. Where does it come from? It turns out that it could have its origin in remolat, an old dialect word for horseradish from the Picardie region of northern France. In effect, the starter dish was named after its two main ingredients: one fiery, the other bland; an incongruous, incompatible duo, you might say, and yet they dance well together here.

The first time I tasted Celeri Remoulade was in Paris at a brasserie called Thoumieux, situated a few blocks from where I used to work in the 7th arrondisement. At first sight, the dish looked nondescript, unremarkable. But on trying it, my taste buds sang and my nose twinkled. Its appearance belied the fire in its belly. The celeriac was the protagonist, yes; it filled the plate with its nutty white flesh; but the pungent sauce was the engine. And I loved it.

I find it is best to prepare the sauce first as the celeriac discolours quickly when left unadorned. So, I start by blending a few tablespoons of Dijon mustard with some mayonnaise (I follow my mother’s recipe, but shop-bought is fine too). To this, I add a good squeeze of lemon juice, a drizzle of olive oil, some grated horseradish and salt and pepper. I taste and adjust the seasoning. The sauce must be strong, pungent to contrast with the reserved celeriac. Et VOILA! My sauce is ready

The remoulade is very versatile and any leftover sauce can be used on cold cuts of meat or chicken; spread on bread instead of butter to make a sandwich, or just used as a dip.

Now for the celeriac.\
There is the brushing off of dirt and dust and the washing of its skin and roots, a meandering forest of limbs, looking at me reminding me of an octopus or some other underwater beast. I dry it and peel it to a smooth globe, chop it in half and slice each half very thinly. I stack the slices on top of each other and cut them into thin matchsticks. Alternatively, I sometimes grate the celeriac (which makes for an easier and more elegant eating experience) or use a food processor with the Julienne attachment to slice it. But I find it therapeutic to do the slicing manually. There is a meditative rhythm in doing it by hand which I find relaxing. After all, this is the only ‘work’ that I will have to engage in. So, I invest a little time and attention in doing it. A fresh celeriac is easier to grate or slice because I have noticed that an old celeriac will be dryer, more hollow and lighter in weight, than a fresh one. The fresher the root the crunchier and more alive its texture.

As soon as the strips are sliced, I stir them into the sauce and garnish the dish with capers or sliced gherkins and finely chopped parsley. You can make it a day before and serve it as a starter, or as an accompaniment to grilled chicken or fish.

So hopefully, the next time a celeriac catches your eye, you will know what to do with it. Bon appetit.

**My mother’s mayonnaise Recipe**

1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard\
1 whole medium egg\
1 or 2 garlic cloves, chopped 3/4 cup, olive oil

1⁄2 teaspoon salt\
1⁄2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\
Combine the lemon juice, the salt and pepper, the mustard and egg in a long beaker. Blend well with a hand blender or whisk. Gradually add the oil, stirring all the while until the oil is incorporated and mixture is thick. Place in the fridge.\
Because of the raw egg, it is best to keep the mayonnaise for only 3 days in the fridge.
