Coming home, mums baked a cake\
made from apples in the garden,\
the aroma wafts over the kitchen\
we vie to lick the spoon, delighting in the bowls sugary scrapings.\
We play football in the garden smashing the neighbours fence.\
They complain but to avail\
Boys will be boys.\
In the pond a fish called Jumbo swims gently by\
we try and catch him but he knows our tricks.\
We go to the riverside park,\
climb the running tree, a bent old willow makes easy climbing.\
Ducks quack in the river and gobble up our stale crusts\
and are always fooled by stones we throw, diving down to catch them\
their feathery bottoms protruding, webbed feet flapping.\
Our weekly pocket money generates a walk to the sweet shop,\
sweets by the dozen, peanut shapes or gobstoppers,\
in the newsagents a free read of the Beano before we are chased away\
This isn't a library you know !\
Just beyond lie the wilds of Hengistbury head.\
Ancient saxon burial mound jutting into the sea.\
We make dens in the undergrowth, trying to start fires with flints\
never succeeding but for a few bright sparks.\
A daring walk on the cliffs, as the waves crash beneath,\
churning up pebbles, we throw back, each trying to be the furthest.\
Boats bob in the estuary harbour , masts clang in the wind,\
Funny folk in beach huts, drink endless teas, their faces ruddy and\
their white feet protrude from rolled up trousers.\
We dig away at their sandy foundations but they never fall down.\
The long trudge home, muddy and happy, long miles\
to little legs, we bring home sticks, fallen branches\
to make perfect weapons or staffs to hold Moses like.\
A birthday arrives, friends are invited, cake and squash, all very civilised, until “Bundle”! one cries, cups are split, chairs knocked over\
The party becomes a writhing mass on the floor,\
dive-bombed from the side and the top.\
Cries of joy emit from this a pudding of delight,\
Children emerge a crumpled and sweaty mass but\
theres jelly to follow and then “For He's a Jolly Good Fellow”.\
Children are dusted off and sent home.\
Up to bed a story is read, cosy under the blankets\
Then time to turn off the light\
and say night night.
