 1 My river reaches the ocean  Just a few miles from home 
The river flows just down my street 
 Serenely Through the willow trees 
Boats put putting along 
To a spit of land 
Salt water permeates 
The Surf crashes in 
Sparkling on our childhood
And splashing up our trousers. ï¿¼

2 My river flows to the sea 

Letting go into the great ocean 
Sacred source of life 
Abundant , ever changing 
Creating and destroying 
All steams flow here 
All are one
